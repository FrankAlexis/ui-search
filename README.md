# Software Engineer Hiring Assignment

It's intended to mimic work you might do here, while giving us an understanding of your skills in:

- Coding
- User Experience

## Tech and UX Project Instructions

As a front-end software engineer, you're asked to build a small prototype that &mdash; using the provided dataset &mdash; highlights the benefits of a great search experience and basic edition capabilities.

- Push the provided dataset to an Algolia index
- Using [React InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/react/) (or another flavor of the InstantSearch library), implement an as-you-type search experience that enables users to easily find restaurants: both by passing a search query and/or filtering on the &ldquo;type of cuisine&rdquo;
- Allow users to delete restaurants from the Algolia index directly from the frontend application
- [bonus] Allow users to add restaurants into the Algolia index directly from the frontend application
- [bonus] Add the search state to the URL

### Important Notes

- The dataset is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jerska/front-end-test/master/dataset/restaurants.json).
- Feel free to use any tooling with which you&rsquo;re most comfortable with, for example: create-react-app, https://codesandbox.io/ or https://glitch.com/ are definitely ok!

## Deliverable

Once you're happy with what you've done

- Publish it using vercel, netlify, or any other service of your choice so we can interact with it
- Send us a link to your finished project's repo via email
- Follow at least the instructions above, but feel free to go beyond if you have ideas &mdash; wow us!

Happy coding!
